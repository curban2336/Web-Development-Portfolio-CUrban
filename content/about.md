Hi! I'm Chris Urban. I am a Game Developer who is currently majoring in a web development degree. I acquired my Associates in Game Development back in 2022 at Raritan Valley Community College, transferring to Albright College after. There, I learned Game and Simulation Design as my Bachelor's. My time as a game dev major taught me many coding practices and After job hunting for almost half a year I decided to expand my education. Now I will have acquired my Associates in Interactive Media and Web Design as of Janurary 2026.

I am fluent in multiple coding languages and pipelines over my years of coding education. As far as web development is concerned, I know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am familiar with Node.js, VS Studio, Github, and Netlify. All of my projects showcased in this website use all of the languages and softwares I have mentioned above.

More recently, on the game development side of my life, I completed an ELVTR course that trained me in the Unreal Game Engine, specifically Unreal 5. This was taught by a professional Game Dev known as Cameron Williams, a dev who worked on Call of Duty, as well as other games while working at Naughty Dog.
