Hi! I'm Chris Urban. I am a Game Developer who is currently majoring in a web development degree. I acquired my Associates in Game Development back in 2022 at Raritan Valley Community College, transferring to Albright College after. There, I learned Game and Simulation Design as my Bachelor's. My time as a game dev major taught me many coding practices and After job hunting for almost half a year I decided to expand my education.
